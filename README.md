# Flutter MVVM with Provider and Stream Architecture

## Overview

This project demonstrates a clean MVVM architecture in Flutter using Provider for dependency injection and state management, with proper lifecycle and stream handling.

---

## Key Concepts

### 1. ViewModel Lifetime Management

- **Short-lived ViewModels (e.g., LoginViewModel)**
  Created on-demand inside route builders.
  New instance per navigation.
  Suitable for one-off operations like login flows.
  Automatically disposed when the screen is removed.

- **Long-lived ViewModels (e.g., ShopViewModel)**
  Created once at the top of the widget tree via `ChangeNotifierProvider`.
  Injected into screens via constructor to maintain the same instance across navigation.
  Enables persistent state and ongoing streams without interruption.
  Disposal handled automatically by Provider.

### 2. Dependency Injection and Testability

- All dependencies (e.g., repositories) are injected into ViewModels via constructor, decoupling them from Flutter UI.
- ViewModels do **not** depend on `BuildContext`, making them easily unit-testable.
- Providers (`Provider`, `ChangeNotifierProvider`) manage creation and lifecycle of dependencies and ViewModels.

### 3. Stream Management and UI Updates

- Data sources expose streams (e.g., `BehaviorSubject`) to emit real-time or periodic updates.
- ViewModels subscribe to these streams and notify listeners on data changes.
- Use of `BehaviorSubject` ensures latest data is available immediately upon subscription, reducing UI flicker.

### 4. Lifecycle and Rebuild Safety

- Avoid calling `dispose()` manually on ViewModels inside widgets if Provider manages them.
- Defer calls that trigger `notifyListeners()` or UI rebuilds using `WidgetsBinding.instance.addPostFrameCallback` to prevent "setState called during build" errors.

### 5. Separation of Concerns

- **Repositories** handle data logic, timers, streams, and resource cleanup.
- **ViewModels** encapsulate business logic, hold UI state, listen to streams, and expose data for the UI.
- **UI screens** receive ViewModels via constructor and react to their state, focusing purely on rendering.

### 6. Navigation and State Preservation

- Long-lived ViewModels maintain state and active streams even when navigating away and back, preventing UI flicker or data reset.
- Short-lived ViewModels reset state each time, ideal for isolated flows.

## Example Snippet

```dart
// Long-lived ViewModel registration at app root
MultiProvider(
  providers: [
    Provider<DataTrafficRepository>(
      create: (_) => DataTrafficRepository(),
      dispose: (_, repo) => repo.dispose(),
    ),
    ChangeNotifierProvider<ShopViewModel>(
      create: (context) => ShopViewModel(
        dataTrafficRepository: context.read<DataTrafficRepository>(),
      ),
    ),
  ],
  child: const MyApp(),
);

// Route using the long-lived ShopViewModel instance
GoRoute(
  path: '/shop',
  builder: (context, state) {
    final vm = context.read<ShopViewModel>();
    return ShopScreen(viewModel: vm);
  },
);

// Short-lived ViewModel instantiated per navigation
GoRoute(
  path: '/login',
  builder: (context, state) => LoginScreen(
    viewModel: LoginViewModel(authRepository: context.read<AuthRepository>()),
  ),
);
```

## Best Practices

- **Always inject dependencies through constructors** for easier testing and flexibility.
- **Use `ChangeNotifierProvider` for ViewModels extending ChangeNotifier** and let Provider handle disposal.
- **Do not call `dispose()` manually on Provider-managed ViewModels inside widgets.**
- **Use `BehaviorSubject` or similar to ensure latest stream data is always available.**
- **Defer initial stream subscriptions or actions that notify UI to after the first frame** to avoid rebuild conflicts.
